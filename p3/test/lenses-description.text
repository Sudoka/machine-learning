This data set involves diagnosing the vision of patients in order to
determine if they would benefit from being fitted with contact
lenses.  Features of the patient are to be used to classify each into
a target category (contact lenses are not advised) or a non-target
category (contact lenses are acceptable).

The columns in the accompanying pattern files contain the
following binary attributes:

 1.  patient's age is "young"
 2.  patient's age is "pre-presbyopic"
 3.  patient's age is "presbyopic"
 4.  patient has myope spectacle prescription
 5.  patient has hypermetrope spectacle prescription
 6.  patient is astigmatic
 7.  patient has reduced tear production rate
 8.  class -- patient should not be fitted with contact lenses

The goal is to predict the 8th attribute from the first seven.

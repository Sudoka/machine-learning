I tried setting up my automake myself this time. As such you may notice that a
bunch of the info documents like INSTALL and COPYING etc. are either blank or
symlinks. I do not know the proper way to fill these out so I'm leaving them as
is for now. I've done my commenting and credit giving inside of the p3_driver
and my report.

Should be a pretty standard ./configure ./make ./p3_driver [FILE] run

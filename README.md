Project 2 Code for John Lusby utilizing David Noelle's reference code as a base (Don't want to lose points incase there are issues with my codebase, never got graded copy back)

Currently done with most of it except the actual meat of the project, but since its a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm implementation it should not be complicated in the slightest

This is the code for my Programming assignements for my Machine Learning course at UC Merced

I'm using a git repo to practice with it as a tool

My current plan is to develop each project as an expansion upon the last since they appear to be dependent upon eachother, as opposed to having a seperate project directory for each assignment. Possibly not the correct solution, but it lets me familiarize myself with git more this way.

This is the code for my Programming assignements for my Machine Learning course at UC Merced

I'm using a git repo to practice with it as a tool

My current plan is to develop each project as an expansion upon the last since they appear to be dependent upon eachother, as opposed to having a seperate project directory for each assignment. Possibly not the correct solution, but it lets me familiarize myself with git more this way.
